# About 

The main motive of this project was to build a search engine, which on the basis of the collection of URLs it has, rank them for a particular query which the user input. The webpage is downloaded, is preprocessed via various tools like BeautifulSoup, Removal of Stopwords, Tokenization, PorterStemmer, extraction of bag of words and then is ranked based on the score obtained with the help of tf-idf model i.e. Term frequency-inverse document frequency model.
